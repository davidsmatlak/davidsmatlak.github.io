Hi, my name is David Smatlak and I'm a technical writer in Seattle, WA. This repository and website
contain my technical writing samples for topics that I find interesting. I research and develop all
the original content, screenshots, and code samples.

This site's purpose is to show examples of how I write and structure content that explains technical
subjects. The website is stored in a GitHub repository and hosted by GitHub Pages. I use Markdown to
write content, and for elements that Markdown doesn't support, I use HTML and CSS code. I customized
some of the Jekyll theme's templates to change how content is displayed.
